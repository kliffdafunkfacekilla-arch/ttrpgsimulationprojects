# Azure OpenAI Integration for AI Agents

* Status: accepted
* Date: 2025-06-10

## Context and Problem Statement

Our AI Dungeon Master system requires powerful LLM capabilities for various aspects of gameplay, including narration, rules management, and character interactions. We need to decide on the specific LLM service to use and how to integrate it.

## Decision Drivers

* Need for high-quality language generation for immersive storytelling
* Support for different agent roles with potentially different model requirements
* Cost considerations for production deployment
* Data privacy and compliance
* Integration with our chosen framework (Semantic Kernel)

## Considered Options

* Option 1: Azure OpenAI Service
    * Microsoft's managed Azure service for OpenAI models
    * Pros:
      * Enterprise-grade reliability and compliance
      * Native integration with Semantic Kernel
      * Regional deployment options for data residency
      * Stable pricing model
      * Service level agreements for production use
    * Cons:
      * Higher cost than direct OpenAI API
      * Regional availability limitations
      * Deployment and capacity management overhead

* Option 2: Direct OpenAI API
    * Accessing OpenAI models directly via their API
    * Pros:
      * Simpler setup process
      * Immediate access to latest models
      * Potentially lower initial costs
    * Cons:
      * Less enterprise focus for reliability
      * Fewer compliance certifications
      * Less predictable pricing for production
      * No regional deployment options

* Option 3: Hybrid Approach
    * Use Azure OpenAI for production with OpenAI API fallback
    * Pros:
      * Flexibility across development and production
      * Access to models not yet in Azure
      * Risk mitigation for availability
    * Cons:
      * More complex configuration
      * Inconsistent behavior across environments
      * Double management overhead

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Azure OpenAI Service"

Justification:
* Enterprise reliability and compliance align with production service requirements
* Native integration with our chosen Semantic Kernel framework
* Regional deployment options support potential international expansion
* Service level agreements provide guarantees for production service
* Consistent pricing model for budgeting and forecasting

## Consequences

### Positive
* Enterprise-grade reliability for production service
* Simplified integration with Semantic Kernel
* Better compliance posture for user data
* Regional deployment options for future expansion

### Negative
* Higher operational complexity for model deployment
* Need to manage quotas and capacity
* Potential delays accessing newest models

### Risks and Mitigations
* Risk: New models may not be immediately available in Azure OpenAI
  * Mitigation: Design system to be model-agnostic where possible
* Risk: Regional availability limitations
  * Mitigation: Establish deployment plans aligned with Azure OpenAI regional availability
* Risk: Quota limitations
  * Mitigation: Early capacity planning and quota requests
