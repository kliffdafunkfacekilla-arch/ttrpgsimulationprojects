# AI Dungeon Master - Product Requirements Document

## Background and Problem Statement

Tabletop roleplaying games (TTRPGs) like Dungeons & Dragons have been a popular form of collaborative storytelling and gaming for decades. However, traditional TTRPGs require a Dungeon Master to orchestrate the game, create narratives, manage rules, and control non-player characters. This creates a significant barrier to entry for new players and those who cannot find a consistent group to play with. Additionally, the complex rules system can be intimidating for beginners and time-consuming even for experienced players.

Many potential players face significant barriers to enjoying tabletop roleplaying games:
- Difficulty finding a skilled and available Dungeon Master
- Challenges coordinating schedules among multiple players
- Steep learning curve for game rules and mechanics
- Limited access to visual aids and battle maps
- Inconsistent gameplay experiences depending on the Dungeon Master's style and preparation
- Inability to play spontaneously or on-demand
- Lack of persistence in character development and campaign progression when groups disband

These barriers prevent many interested players from experiencing the rich storytelling and immersive gameplay that TTRPGs can offer, resulting in a significant unmet demand in the market.

## Product Vision Statement

Secure the Realm will democratize access to high-quality tabletop roleplaying experiences by providing an AI-powered platform that eliminates the need for a human Dungeon Master while preserving the creativity, flexibility, and immersion of traditional TTRPGs. Our vision is to create a system where anyone, anywhere can instantly jump into a personalized adventure tailored to their preferences, play style, and available time. Through specialized AI agents working in concert, we will deliver a seamless, engaging, and visually rich gaming experience that adapts to player choices and creates memorable stories worth sharing.

## Architecture

The Secure the Realm platform is built on the Microsoft Agent Framework (Azure AI Agents SDK) with a TypeScript frontend. The Agent Framework provides a production-grade multi-agent architecture, where each agent serves a specialized role in the tabletop RPG experience. The framework interfaces with Azure OpenAI LLMs using Python to enable agent orchestration with tools and functions. This allows the agents to perform tasks like storing and retrieving data. The framework enables intelligent selection of the correct AI agent and tool for the task at hand through built-in orchestration patterns, rather than relying on strict workflows.

## Agent Definitions

1. **Dungeon Master Agent (Orchestrator Agent)**
   - Primary user-facing agent that coordinates all other agents
   - Manages player interactions and conversation flow
   - Routes appropriate tasks to specialized agents
   - Maintains cohesion across the gameplay experience
   - Ensures continuity of game rules and narrative

2. **Narrator Agent**
   - Manages campaign narrative and storylines
   - Determines whether a skill check is required
   - Handles skill checks, and outcomes
   - Maintains campaign facts and story elements
   - Generates descriptions of environments, NPCs, and situations
   - Interprets player actions within the game world context
   - Stores key narrative data in structured format for recall

3. **Scribe Agent**
   - Manages character sheets and player data
   - Tracks inventory, equipment, and loot
   - Handles NPC data and attributes
   - Monitors spell slots, abilities, and resources
   - Manages character progression including level-ups, experience tracking, and ability score improvements
   - Enforces D&D 5e progression rules and validates character advancement
   - Maintains structured data records for lookup and recall excluding campaign data managed by Narrator

4. **Combat MC Agent**
   - Creates balanced encounter scenarios based on narrative context from Dungeon Master
   - Manages enemy tactics and behaviors
   - Track initiative order and combat state
   - Integrates with Combat Cartographer to ensure effective encounter details related to the battle map
   - Integrates with Narrator for narrative around combat outcomes

5. **Combat Cartographer Agent**
   - Generates tactical battle maps based on narrative context from Narrator

6. **Artist Agent**
   - Generates visual imagery based on narrative moments
   - Creates character portraits and NPC visualizations
   - Illustrates environments and locations
   - Produces visual aids for important items, maps, and scenes
   - Enhances immersion through visual storytelling

## Communication Flow

While the Dungeon Master serves as the orchestrator, agents communicate through the Agent Framework's orchestration patterns:
- Agents share context through threads and messages in the Azure AI Agents SDK
- The Dungeon Master synthesizes responses from multiple agents into coherent player-facing output
- Each agent maintains its specialized knowledge domain while contributing to the whole experience
- Agent communication is managed by the Microsoft Agent Framework orchestration layer

## Technical Requirements

### Core System

- **Framework**: TypeScript frontend with Python backend leveraging Microsoft Agent Framework (Azure AI Agents SDK). See Architecture section above (lines 23-24) and ADR-0018 for details.
- **State Management**: Robust state tracking for game progression

### Game Engine

- **Rules Implementation**: D&D 5e OGL SRD ruleset
- **Dice Rolling System**: Virtual dice implementation supporting all standard RPG dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d100) and the ability of the user to bring their own dice by telling the DM what their roll or total score was
- **Character Management**: Character creation, leveling, and stat tracking in line with standard character sheets for 5th edition e.g. feats
- **Character Progression**: Experience-based leveling system with automatic proficiency bonus scaling, ability score improvements at appropriate levels (4, 8, 12, 16, 19), and hit point calculation using class-specific hit dice

- **Spell System**: Implementation of 5e spell mechanics and spell slots

### User Interface

- **Chat Interface**: Primary interaction through natural language conversation
- **Character Sheet Display**: Visual representation of character data available within the app
- **Map Visualization**: Display battle maps and illustrations separate to the chat interface the player is interacting with
- **Image Gallery**: Storage for generated artistic imagery and battle maps separate to the chat interface by the application (not the AI) saving that image and updating the image URL
- **Dice Roll Visibility**: Numeric feedback for dice outcomes where the game has rolled on behalf of the player, at the request of the player
- **Session History**: Summary record of game events and conversations


## Workflows

### Campaign Creation Workflow

1. Player describes desired campaign setting, tone, style and any homebrew rules
2. Dungeon Master coordinates with Narrator to establish world and setting
3. Artist generates world concept imagery which is then saved by the application, and then the image URL is updated in the 'art' window of the webapp
4. Dungeon Master guides players through character creation process
5. Scribe creates and populates templates for character creation based upon player instruction

### Gameplay Loop

1. Player inputs action or statement
2. Dungeon Master interprets and routes to appropriate agent(s)
3. Agent(s) process request and generate responses
4. Narrator updates narrative state as needed
5. Scribe updates character/world data as needed
6. Combat MC creates combat scenarios when triggered and when applicable only
7. Artist generates imagery for significant moments
8. Dungeon Master synthesizes responses and presents to player

### Combat Workflow

1. Combat MC establishes combat environment and participants
2. Scribe provides character and NPC statistics
3. Narrator provides narrative context
4. Combat Cartographer generates tactical map, and then the image URL is updated in the 'map' window of the webapp
5. Artist visualizes the battle scene
6. Combat rounds proceed through initiative order
7. Playertakes their actions and makes their decisions
8. Dungeon Master narrates combat outcomes and effects
9. Continue between Player and Combat MC working through each player and NPC's turns until the combat ends
