Factory classes for generating test data using pytest-factoryboy.

This module provides factory classes for creating common test data patterns,
reducing code duplication and making tests more maintainable.

Note: This module requires factory_boy to be installed. If factory_boy is not
available, importing this module will raise an ImportError.
